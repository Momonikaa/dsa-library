# C++ STANDARD TEMPLATE LIBRARY
This is a C++ Standard Data Structures Implementation Library which provides a robust implementation of some fundamental well known data structures as well as some extra advanced data structures like Binary Search Trees for dictionary problem. Some other not so well known data structures like Splay Trees are implemented. The primary focus lies on a robust implementation of self-balancing BSTs and nearly balanced BSTs.

## DIRECTORY INCLUDES
1) **src** - Containing source code header files for the library
2) **examples** - Example programs and tutorials on usage of the library
3) **testing** - Testcases for testing purposes
